## PIPE Protocol Overview
[PIPE](https://github.com/BennyTheDev/pipe-specs) is a Bitcoin-native token protocol with three main functions:

**Deploy**, **Mint**, and **Transfer** (DMT):

- **Deploy**: Initiates a new token with defined attributes like ticker name, maximum supply, and minting limits.
- **Mint**: Allows the creation of new tokens within the defined limits set during deployment.
- **Transfer**: Facilitates the sending of tokens to selected recipients.

The PIPE protocol, by introducing a structured way to deploy, mint, and transfer tokens on the Bitcoin network, provides a framework for tokenized assets and applications which isn't natively supported by Bitcoin. This potentially allows for a variety of decentralized applications (dApps), tokenized assets, and smart contract-like behaviors on Bitcoin, which are features more commonly associated with platforms like Ethereum.
In essence, it can bring a new level of functionality to Bitcoin while still utilizing Bitcoin's robust and secure blockchain.
